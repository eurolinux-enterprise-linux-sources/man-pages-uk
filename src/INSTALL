	HOW TO INSTALL MANPAGES-UK

The simplest way to install man-pages-uk is, as always,

	$ make install

This will install manpages to /usr/local/share/man/$LANG/man[1-8]/.
If there are old versions of manpages (possibly compressed), 'make
install' will remove them first.  If size of new manpage is greater
than 4096 bytes, 'make install' will compress it with gzip.


The installation process is customisable:

	$ make install INSTALLPATH=/usr/man

will install manpages to /usr/man/$LANG/man[1-8]/.

	$ make install INSTALLPATH=/usr/man LANG_SUBDIR=uk

will install manpages to /usr/man/uk/man[1-8]/.

	$ make install COMPRESS=bzip2

will compress manpages with bzip2.  Known compressors are 'none' (do
not compress), 'gzip', 'compress' and 'bzip2'.  Compressor options
could be specified with COMPRESS_OPTIONS.

	$make install COMPRESS_SIZE=0

will compress every manpage however small it is.

After setup change environment variable: $MANPATH
 export MANPATH=/usr/share/man/uk:$MANPATH
